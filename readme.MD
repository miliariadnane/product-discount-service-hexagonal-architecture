# 🌟 Hexagonal Architecture in Spring Boot with DDD - Product Discount Service 🌟

> A practical demonstration of Hexagonal Architecture in Spring Boot with Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles for a dynamic Product Discount Service. This project emphasizes clean code, testability, and architectural best practices.

💡 This project is a part of my presentation to my team **`@Transperfect`** where I explore Hexagonal Architecture and its application in real-world scenarios. While this application is not business-oriented, its primary focus is on showcasing technical aspects and serving as a learning resource.

🌀 This Application is `in-progress 🚧` and I will add new features over time. 🌀

-----------------

## Key Features

✅ **Hexagonal Architecture**: The application is structured following the Hexagonal Architecture pattern, allowing for clean separation of concerns.

✅ **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**: Learn how to model complex business domains using DDD concepts like aggregates, entities, and value objects.

✅ **Spring Boot**: Take advantage of Spring Boot to create a production-ready application with minimal configuration.

✅ **Dynamic Pricing**: Implement dynamic pricing strategies that consider various factors, such as product category, manufacturer, and special events.

✅ **Unit Testing**: Discover the importance of unit testing and how it enhances code quality and maintainability.
